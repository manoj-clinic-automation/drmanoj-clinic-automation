# install_s735.sh -- S735_STMT_LAST_MONTH (board _numbers v992 -> v993; D845 item 1; built in the Scan App chat, session 395,
#   06-Nov-2026). The Variety flow checked live: no statement was ever made, and the Stationery page offers only the CURRENT month's
#   statement -- so October's could no longer be made on its own. Now, while no statement stands for the month just ended (nor for
#   this month) and it has unbilled lines, the page offers "Make <last month>'s statement" first; once it stands, the page is as
#   before. ONE file: /root/assetapp/stationery.py 3a22c6bb -> TO, rebuilt on the box by make_s735.py (6 counted edits) and checked
#   against the kit's whole file. No data step; no table; restarts assetapp only.
# Run as root on the VPS: cd /root/deploy/repo && git pull --ff-only && bash /root/deploy/repo/deploy_kits/S735_STMT_LAST_MONTH/install_s735.sh
